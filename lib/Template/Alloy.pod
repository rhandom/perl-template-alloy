CGI::Ex::Template - Fast and lightweight TT2/3 template engine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $t = CGI::Ex::Template->new(
        INCLUDE_PATH => ['/path/to/templates'],
    );

    my $swap = {
        key1 => 'val1',
        key2 => 'val2',
        code => sub { 42 },
        hash => {a => 'b'},
    };

    $t->process('my/template.tt', $swap)
        || die $t->error;

    ### Anything in the Template::Toolkit SYNOPSIS would fit here also

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CGI::Ex::Template happened by accident.  The CGI::Ex suite included a
base set of modules for doing anything from simple to complicated CGI
applications.  Part of the suite was a simple variable interpolater
that used TT2 style variables in TT2 style tags "[% foo.bar %]".  This
was fine and dandy for a couple of years.  In winter of 2005-2006 CET
was revamped to add a few features.  One thing led to another and now
CET provides for most of the features of TT2 as well as some from TT3.
CET is a fulfeatured implementation of the Template::Toolkit language.

CGI::Ex::Template (CET hereafter) is smaller, faster, uses less memory
and less CPU than TT2.  However, it is most likely less portable, less
extendable, and probably has many of the bugs that TT2 has already massaged
out from years of bug reports and patches from a very active community
and mailing list.  CET does not have a vibrant community behind it.  Fixes
applied to TT2 will take longer to get into CET, should they get in at all.
An attempt will be made to follow updates made to TT2 to keep the two
in sync at a language level.  There already has been, and it is expected that
there will continue to be code sharing between the two projects.

Most of the standard Template::Toolkit documentation covering directives,
variables, configuration, plugins, filters, syntax, and vmethods should
apply to CET just fine (This pod tries to explain everything - but there is
too much).  The section on differences between CET and TT will explain
what too look out for.

Note: A clarification on "faster".  All templates are going to take
different amounts of time to process.  Different types of DIRECTIVES
parse and play more quickly than others.  The test script
samples/benchmark/bench_template.pl was used to obtain sample numbers.
In general the following statements are true:

    If you load a new Template object each time and pass a filename, CET
    is around 4 times faster.

    If you load a new Template object and pass a string ref, CET
    is around 3.5 times faster.

    If you load a new Template object and use CACHE_EXT, CET
    is around 1.5 times faster.

    If you use a cached object with a cached in memory template,
    then CET is 50% faster.

    If you use Template::Stash::XS with a cached in memory template,
    then CET is about as fast.

It is pretty hard to beat the speed of XS stash with compiled in
memory templates.  Many systems don't have access to those so
CET may make more sense.  Hopefully as TT is revised, many of the CET
speed advantages can be incorporated so that the core TT is just as
fast or faster.

So should you use CGI::Ex::Template ?  Well, try it out.  It may
give you no visible improvement.  Or it could.


=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=over 4

=item new

    my $obj = CGI::Ex::Template->new({
        INCLUDE_PATH => ['/my/path/to/content', '/my/path/to/content2'],
    });

    Arguments may be passed as a hash or as a hashref.  Returns a CGI::Ex::Template object.

    There are currently no errors during CGI::Ex::Template object creation.

=item process

This is the main method call for staring processing.  Any errors that results in the
template being stopped processing will be stored and available via the ->error method.

Process takes three arguments.

    $t->process($in, $swap, $out)
        || die $t->error;

The $in argument can be any one of:

    String containing the filename of the template to be processed.  The filename should
    be relative to INCLUDE_PATH.  (See INCLUDE_PATH, ABSOLUTE, and RELATIVE configuration items).
    In memory caching and fileside caching are available for this type.

    A reference to a scalar containing the contents of the template to be processed.

    A coderef that will be called to return the contents of the template.

    An open filehandle that will return the contents of the template when read.

The $swap argument should be hashref containing key value pairs that will be
available to variables swapped into the template.  Values can be hashrefs, hashrefs
of hashrefs and so on, arrayrefs, arrayrefs of arrayrefs and so on, coderefs, objects,
and simple scalar values such as numbers and strings.  See the section on variables.

The $out argument can be any one of:

    undef - meaning to print the completed template to STDOUT.

    String containing a filename.  The completed template will be placed in the file.

    A reference to a string.  The contents will be appended to the scalar reference.

    A coderef.  The coderef will be called with the contents as a single argument.

    An object that can run the method "print".  The contents will be passed as
    a single argument to print.

    An arrayref.  The contents will be pushed onto the array.

    An open filehandle.  The contents will be printed to the open handle.

Additionally - the $out argument can be configured using the OUTPUT configuration
item.

=item process_simple

Similar to the process method but with the following restrictions:

The $in parameter is limited to a filename or a reference a string containing the contents.

The $out parameter may only be a reference to a scalar string that ouput will be appended to.

Additionally, the following configuration variables will be ignored:  VARIABLES,
PRE_DEFINE, BLOCKS, PRE_PROCESS, PROCESS, POST_PROCESS, AUTO_RESET, OUTPUT.

=item error

Should something go wrong during a "process" command, the error that occured can
be retrieved via the error method.

    $obj->process('somefile.html', {a => 'b'}, \$string_ref)
        || die $obj->error;

=item define_vmethod

This method is available for defining extra Virtual methods or filters.  This method is similar
to Template::Stash::define_vmethod.

=back

=head1 SEMI PUBLIC METHODS

The following list of methods are other interesting methods of CET that
may be re-implemented by subclasses of CET.


exception - Creates an exception object blessed into the package listed in
$CGI::Ex::Template::PACKAGE_EXCEPTION.

execute_tree - Executes a parsed tree (returned from parse_tree)

get_variable - Turns a variable identity array into the parsed variable.  This
method is also repsonsible for playing opererators and running virtual methods
and filters.  The method could more accurately be called play_expression.

include_filename - Takes a file path, and resolves it into the full filename using
paths from INCLUDE_PATH or INCLUDE_PATHS.

_insert - Resolves the file passed, and then returns its contents.

list_filters - Dynamically loads the filters list from Template::Filters when a filter
is used that is not natively implemented in CET.

list_plugins - Returns an arrayref of modules that are under a base Namespace.

  my @modules = @{ $self->list_plugins({base => 'Template::Plugins'}) }:

load_parsed_tree - Given a filename or a string reference will return a parsed document
hash that contains the parsed tree.

  my $doc = $self->load_parsed_tree($file) || $self->throw('undef', "Zero length content");

parse_args - Allow for the multitudinous ways that TT parses arguments.  This allows
for positional as well as named arguments.  Named arguments can be separated with a "=" or "=>",
and positional arguments should be separated by " " or ",".  This only returns an array
of parsed variables.  Use vivify_args to translate to the actual values.

parse_tree - Used by load_parsed_tree.  This is the main grammar engine of the program.  It
uses method in the $DIRECTIVES hashref to parse different DIRECTIVE TYPES.

parse_variable - Used to parse a variable, an expression, a literal string, or a number.  It
returns a parsed variable tree.  Samples of parsed variables can be found in the VARIABLE PARSE TREE
section.

set_variable - Used to set a variable.  Expects a variable identity array and the value to set.  It
will autovifiy as necessary.

throw - Creates an exception object from the arguments and dies.

undefined_any - Called during get_variable if a value is returned that is undefined.  This could
be used to magically create variables on the fly.  This is similar to Template::Stash::undefined.
It is suggested that undefined_get be used instead.  Default behavior returns undef.  You
may also pass a coderef via the UNDEFINED_ANY configuration variable.  Also, you can try using
the DEBUG => 'undef', configuration option which will throw an error on undefined variables.

undefined_get - Called when a variable is undefined during a GET directive.  This is useful to
see if a value that is about to get inserted into the text is undefined.  undefined_any is a little
too general for most cases.  Also, you may pass a coderef via the UNDEFINED_GET configuration variable.

vivify_args - Turns an arrayref of arg identities parsed by parse_args and turns
them into the actual values.


=head1 OTHER UTILITY METHODS

The following is a brief list of other methods used by CET.  Generally, these
shouldn't be overwritten by subclasses.

apply_precedence - allows for parsed operator array to be translated to a tree based
upon operator precedence.

context - used to create a "pseudo" context object that allows for portability
of TT plugins, filters, and perl blocks that need a context object.

DEBUG - TT2 Holdover that is used once for binmode setting during a TT2 test.

debug_node - used to get debug info on a directive if DEBUG_DIRS is set.

filter_* - implement filters that are more than one line.

get_line_number_by_index - used to turn string index position into line number

interpolate_node - used for parsing text nodes for dollar variables when interpolate is on.

parse_* - used by parse_tree to parse the template.  These are the grammar.

play_* - used by execute_tree to execute the parsed tree.

play_operator - to execute any found operators

_process - called by process and the PROCESS, INCLUDE and other directives.

slurp - reads contents of passed filename - throws file exception on error.

split_paths - used to split INCLUDE_PATH or other directives if an arrayref is not passed.

_vars - Return a reference to the current stash of variables.  This is currently only used
by the pseudo context object and may disappear at some point.

vmethod_* - implement virtual methods that are more than one line.

weak_copy - used to create a weak reference to self to avoid circular references. (this
is needed by macros)

=head1 TODO

    Add WRAPPER config item

    Add ERROR config item

=head1 HOW IS CGI::Ex::Template DIFFERENT

CET uses the same template syntax and configuration items
as TT2, but the internals of CET were written from scratch.  In
addition to this, the following is a list of some of the ways that
configuration and syntax of CET different from that of TT.

=over 4

Numerical hash keys work [% a = {1 => 2} %]

Quoted hash key interpolation is fine [% a = {"$foo" => 1} %]

Multiple ranges in same constructor [% a = [1..10, 21..30] %]

Construtor types can call virtual methods

   [% a = [1..10].reverse %]

   [% "$foo".length %]

   [% 123.length %]   # = 3

   [% 123.4.length %]  # = 5

   [% -123.4.length %] # = -5 ("." binds more tightly than "-")

   [% (a ~ b).length %]

   [% "hi".repeat(3) %]

   [% {a => b}.size %]

Reserved names are less reserved

   [% GET GET %] # gets the variable named "GET"

   [% GET $GET %] # gets the variable who's name is stored in "GET"

Filters and SCALAR_OPS are interchangeable.

   [% a | length %]

   [% b . lower %]

Pipe "|" can be used anywhere dot "." can be and means to call
the virtual method.

   [% a = {size => "foo"} %][% a.size %] # = foo

   [% a = {size => "foo"} %][% a|size %] # = 1 (size of hash)

Pipe "|" and "." can be mixed.

   [% "aa" | repeat(2) . length %] # = 4

Whitespace is less meaningful.

   [% 2-1 %] # = 1 (fails in TT)

Added pow operator.

   [% 2 ** 3 %] [% 2 pow 3 %] # = 8 8

FOREACH variables can be nested

   [% FOREACH f.b = [1..10] ; f.b ; END %]

   Note that nested variables are subject to scoping issues.
   f.b will not be reset to its value before the FOREACH.

Post operative directives can be nested.

   [% one IF two IF three %]

   same as

   [% IF three %][% IF two %][% one %][% END %][% END %]


   [% a = [[1..3], [5..7]] %][% i FOREACH i = j FOREACH j = a %] # = 123567

CATCH blocks can be empty.

CET does not generate Perl code.  It generates an "opcode" tree.

CET uses storable for its compiled templates.  If EVAL_PERL is off,
CET will not eval_string on ANY piece of information.

There is no context.  CET provides a context object that mimics the
Template::Context interface for use by some TT filters, eval perl
blocks, and plugins.

There is no stash.  CET only supports the variables passed in
VARIABLES, PRE_DEFINE, and those passed to the process method.  CET
provides a stash object that mimics the Template::Stash interface for
use by some TT filters, eval perl blocks, and plugins.

There is no provider.  CET uses the load_parsed_tree method to get and
cache templates.

There is no grammar.  CET has its own built in grammar system.

There is no VIEW directive.

There are no references.  (There was in initial beta tests, but it was decided
to remove the little used feature).

The DEBUG directive only understands DEBUG_DIRS (8) and DEBUG_UNDEF (2).

When debug dirs is on, directives on different lines separated by colons show the line they
are on rather than a general line range.

There is no ANYCASE configuration item.  There was in initial beta tests, but it
was dropped in favor of consistent parsing syntax.

There is no V1DOLLAR configuration item.  This is a TT version 1 compatibility item and
is not available in CET.

=head1 VARIABLES

This section discusses variables that can be used in the TT syntax.



=head1 DIRECTIVES

This section containts the alphabetical list of DIRECTIVES available in
the TT language.  DIRECTIVES are the "functions" that implement the Template Toolkit
mini-language.  For further discussion and examples, please refer to the
TT directives documentation.


=over 4

=item BLOCK

Saves a block of text under a name for later use in PROCESS, INCLUDE,
and WRAPPER directives.  Blocks may be placed anywhere within the
template being processed including after where they are used.

    [% BLOCK foo %]Some text[% END %]
    [% PROCESS foo %]

    Would print

    Some text

    [% INCLUDE foo %]
    [% BLOCK foo %]Some text[% END %]

    Would print

    Some text

Anonymous BLOCKS can be used for capturing.

    [% a = BLOCK %]Some text[% END %][% a %]

    Would print

    Some text

Anonymous BLOCKS can be used with macros.


=item BREAK

Alias for LAST.  Used for exiting FOREACH and WHILE loops.

=item CALL

Calls the variable (and any underlying coderefs) as in the GET method, but
always returns an empty string.

=item CASE

Used with the SWITCH directive.  See the L</"SWITCH"> directive.

=item CATCH

Used with the TRY directive.  See the L</"TRY"> directive.

=item CLEAR

Clears any of the content currently generated in the innermost block
or template.  This can be useful when used in conjuction with the TRY
statement to clear generated content if an error occurs later.

=item DEBUG

Used to reset the DEBUG_FORMAT configuration variable, or to turn
DEBUG statements on or off.  This only has effect if the DEBUG_DIRS or
DEBUG_ALL flags were passed to the DEBUG configuration variable.

    [% DEBUG format '($file) (line $line) ($text)' %]
    [% DEBUG on %]
    [% DEBUG off %]

=item DEFAULT

Similar to SET, but only sets the value if a previous value was not
defined or was zero length.

    [% DEFAULT foo = 'bar' %][% foo %] => 'bar'

    [% foo = 'baz' %][% DEFAULT foo = 'bar' %][% foo %] => 'baz'

=item DUMP

This is not provided in TT.  DUMP inserts a Data::Dumper printout
of the variable or expression.  If no argument is passed it will
dump the entire contents of the current variable stash (with
private keys removed.

If the template is being processed in a web request, DUMP will html
encode the DUMP automatically.

    [% DUMP %] # dumps everything

    [% DUMP 1 + 2 %]

=item ELSE

Used with the IF directive.  See the L</"IF"> directive.

=item ELSIF

Used with the IF directive.  See the L</"IF"> directive.

=item END

Used to end a block directive.

=item FILTER

Used to apply different treatments to blocks of text.  It may operate as a BLOCK
directive or as a post operative directive.  CET supports all of the filters in
Template::Filters.  The lines between scalar virtual methods and filters is blurred (or
non-existent) in CET.  Anything that is a scalar virtual method may be used as a FILTER.

TODO - enumerate the at least 7 ways to pass and use filters.

=item '|'

Alias for the FILTER directive.  Note that | is similar to the
'.' in CGI::Ex::Template.  Therefore a pipe cannot be used directly after a
variable name in some situations (the pipe will act only on that variable).
This is the behavior employed by TT3.

=item FINAL

Used with the TRY directive.  See the L</"TRY"> directive.

=item FOR

Alias for FOREACH

=item FOREACH

Allows for iterating over the contents of any arrayref.  If the variable is not an
arrayref, it is automatically promoted to one.

    [% FOREACH i IN [1 .. 3] %]
        The variable i = [% i %]
    [%~ END %]

    [% a = [1 .. 3] %]
    [% FOREACH j IN a %]
        The variable j = [% j %]
    [%~ END %]

Would print:

        The variable i = 1
        The variable i = 2
        The variable i = 3

        The variable j = 1
        The variable j = 2
        The variable j = 3

You can also use the "=" instead of "IN" or "in".

    [% FOREACH i = [1 .. 3] %]
        The variable i = [% i %]
    [%~ END %]

    Same as before.

Setting into a variable is optional.

    [% a = [1 .. 3] %]
    [% FOREACH a %] Hi [% END %]

Would print:

     hi  hi  hi 

If the item being iterated is a hashref and the FOREACH does not
set into a variable, then values of the hashref are copied into
the variable stash.

    [% FOREACH [{a => 1}, {a => 2}] %]
        Key a = [% a %]
    [%~ END %]

Would print:

        Key a = 1
        Key a = 2

The FOREACH process uses the CGI::Ex::Template::Iterator class to handle
iterations (It is compatible with Template::Iterator).  During the FOREACH
loop an object blessed into the iterator class is stored in the variable "loop".

The loop variable provides the following information during a FOREACH:

    index  - the current index
    max    - the max index of the list
    size   - the number of items in the list
    count  - index + 1
    number - index + 1
    first  - true if on the first item
    last   - true if on the last item
    next   - return the next item in the list
    prev   - return the previous item in the list

The following:

    [% FOREACH [1 .. 3] %] [% loop.count %]/[% loop.size %] [% END %]

Would print:

     1/3  2/3  3/3 

The iterator is also available using a plugin.  This allows for access
to multiple "loop" variables in a nested FOREACH directive.

    [%~ USE outer_loop = Iterator(["a", "b"]) %]
    [%~ FOREACH i = outer_loop %]
        [%~ FOREACH j = ["X", "Y"] %]
           [% outer_loop.count %]-[% loop.count %] = ([% i %] and [% j %])
        [%~ END %]
    [%~ END %]

Would print:

           1-1 = (a and X)
           1-2 = (a and Y)
           2-1 = (b and X)
           2-2 = (b and Y)

=item GET

Return the value of a variable or expression.

    [% GET a %]

The GET keyword may be omitted.

    [% a %]

    [% 7 + 2 - 3 %] => 6

See the section on VARIABLES.

=item IF (IF / ELSIF / ELSE)

Allows for conditional testing.  Expects an expression as its only
argument.  If the expression is true, the contents of its block are
processed.  If false, the processor looks for an ELSIF block.  If an
ELSIF's expression is true then it is processed.  Finally it looks for
an ELSE block which is processed if none of the IF or ELSIF's
expressions were true.

    [% IF a == b %]A equaled B[% END %]

    [% IF a == b -%]
        A equaled B
    [%- ELSIF a == c -%]
        A equaled C
    [%- ELSE -%]
        Couldn't determine that A equaled anything.
    [%- END %]

If may also be used as a post operative directive.

    [% 'A equaled B' IF a == b %]

=item INCLUDE

Parse the contents of a file or block and insert them.  Variables defined
or modifications made to existing variables are discarded after
a template is included.

    [% INCLUDE path/to/template.html %]

    [% INCLUDE "path/to/template.html" %]

    [% file = "path/to/template.html" %]
    [% INCLUDE $file %]

    [% BLOCK foo %]This is foo[% END %]
    [% INCLUDE foo %]

Arguments may also be passed to the template:

    [% INCLUDE "path/to/template.html" a = "An arg" b = "Another arg" %]

Filenames must be relative to INCLUDE_PATH unless the ABSOLUTE
or RELATIVE configuration items are set.

=item INSERT

Insert the contents of a file without template parsing.

Filenames must be relative to INCLUDE_PATH unless the ABSOLUTE
or RELATIVE configuration items are set.

=item LAST

Used to exit out of a WHILE or FOREACH loop.

=item MACRO

Takes a directive and turns it into a variable that can take arguments.

    [% MACRO foo(i, j) BLOCK %]You passed me [% i %] and [% j %].[% END %]

    [%~ foo("a", "b") %]
    [% foo(1, 2) %]

Would print:

    You passed me a and b.
    You passed me 1 and 2.

Another example:

    [% MACRO bar(max) FOREACH i = [1 .. max] %]([% i %])[% END %]

    [%~ bar(4) %]

Would print:

    (1)(2)(3)(4)

=item META

Used to define variables that will be available via either the
template or component namespace.

Once defined, they cannot be overwritten.

    [% template.foobar %]
    [%~ META foobar = 'baz' %]
    [%~ META foobar = 'bing' %]

Would print:

    baz

=item NEXT

Used to go to the next iteration of a WHILE or FOREACH loop.

=item PERL

Only available if the EVAL_PERL configuration item is true (default is false).

Allow evaling the block of text as perl.  The block will be parsed and then evaled.

    [% a = "BimBam" %]
    [%~ PERL %]
        my $a = "[% a %]";
        print "The variable \$a was \"$a\"";
        $stash->set('b', "FooBar");
    [% END %]
    [% b %]

Would print:

    The variable $a was "BimBam"
    FooBar

During execution, anything printed to stdout will be inserted into the template.  Also,
the $stash and $context variables are set and are references to objects that mimic the
interface provided by Template::Context and Template::Stash.  These are provided for
compatibility only.  $self contains the current CGI::Ex::Template object.

=item PROCESS

Parse the contents of a file or block and insert them.  Unlike INCLUDE,
no variable localization happens so variables defined or modifications made
to existing variables remain after the template is processed.

    [% PROCESS path/to/template.html %]

    [% PROCESS "path/to/template.html" %]

    [% file = "path/to/template.html" %]
    [% PROCESS $file %]

    [% BLOCK foo %]This is foo[% END %]
    [% PROCESS foo %]

Arguments may also be passed to the template:

    [% PROCESS "path/to/template.html" a = "An arg" b = "Another arg" %]

Filenames must be relative to INCLUDE_PATH unless the ABSOLUTE
or RELATIVE configuration items are set.

=item RAWPERL

Only available if the EVAL_PERL configuration item is true (default is false).
Similar to the PERL directive, but you will need to append
to the $output variable rather than just calling PRINT.

=item RETURN

Used to exit the innermost block or template and continue processing
in the surrounding block or template.

=item SET

Used to set variables.

   [% SET a = 1 %][% a %]             => "1"
   [% a = 1 %][% a %]                 => "1"
   [% b = 1 %][% SET a = b %][% a %]  => "1"
   [% a = 1 %][% SET a %][% a %]      => ""
   [% SET a = [1, 2, 3] %][% a.1 %]   => "2"
   [% SET a = {b => 'c'} %][% a.b %]  => "c"

=item STOP

Used to exit the entire process method (out of all blocks and templates).
No content will be processed beyond this point.

=item SWITCH

Allow for SWITCH and CASE functionality.

   [% a = "hi" %]
   [% b = "bar" %]
   [% SWITCH a %]
       [% CASE "foo"           %]a was foo
       [% CASE b               %]a was bar
       [% CASE ["hi", "hello"] %]You said hi or hello
       [% CASE DEFAULT         %]I don't know what you said
   [% END %]

Would print:

   You said hi or hello

=item TAGS

Change the type of enclosing braces used to delineate template tags.  This
remains in effect until the end of the enclosing block or template or until
the next TAGS directive.  Either a named set of tags must be supplied, or
two tags themselves must be supplied.

    [% TAGS html %]

    [% TAGS <!-- --> %]

The named tags are (duplicated from TT):

    template => ['[%',   '%]'],  # default
    metatext => ['%%',   '%%'],  # Text::MetaText
    star     => ['[*',   '*]'],  # TT alternate
    php      => ['<?',   '?>'],  # PHP
    asp      => ['<%',   '%>'],  # ASP
    mason    => ['<%',   '>' ],  # HTML::Mason
    html     => ['<!--', '-->'], # HTML comments


=item THROW



=item TRY



=item UNLESS

Same as IF but condition is negated.

    [% UNLESS 0 %]hi[% END %]  => hi


=item USE

Allows for loading a Template::Toolkit style plugin.


See the documentation for Template::Manual::Plugins.

=item WHILE




=item WRAPPER

Block directive.  Processes contents of its block and then passes them
in the [% content %] variable to the block or filename listed in the
WRAPPER tag.

    [% WRAPPER foo %]
    My content to be processed.[% a = 2 %]
    [% END %]

    [% BLOCK foo %]
    A header ([% a %]).
    [% content %]
    A footer ([% a %]).
    [% END %]

This would print.

    A header (2).
    My content to be processed.
    A footer (2).

The WRAPPER directive may also be used as a post directive.

    [% BLOCK baz %]([% content %])[% END -%]
    [% "foobar" WRAPPER baz %]

Would print

    (foobar)');

=head1 OPERATORS

The following operators are available in CGI::Ex::Template.  Except
where noted these are the same operators available in TT.  They are
listed in the order of their precedence (the higher the precedence the
tighter it binds).

=over 4

=item C<.>

Binary.  The dot operator.  Allows for accessing sub-members, methods, or
virtual methods of nested data structures.

    my $obj->process(\$content, {a => {b => [0, {c => [34, 57]}]}}, \$output);

    [% a.b.1.c.0 %] => 34

Note: on access to hashrefs, any hash keys that match the sub key
name will be used before a virtual method of the same name.  For example if a
passed hash contained pair with a keyname "defined" and a value of "2", then
any calls to hash.defined(subkeyname) would always return 2 rather
than using the vmethod named "defined."  To get around this limitation use the
"|" operator (listed next).

=item C<|>

Binary.  The pipe operator.  Similar to the dot operator.  Allows for
explicit calling of virtual methods and filters (filters are "merged"
with virtual methods in CGI::Ex::Template and TT3) when accessing
hashrefs.  See the note for the "." operator.

The pipe character is similar to TT2 in that it can be used in place
of a directive as an alias for FILTER.  It similar to TT3 in that it
can be used for virtual method access.  This duality is one source of
difference between CGI::Ex::Template and TT2 compatibility.  Templates
that have directives that end with a variable name that then use the
"|" directive to apply a filter will be broken as the "|" will be
applied to the variable name.

The following two cases will do the same thing.

    [% foo | html %]

    [% foo FILTER html %]

Though they do the same thing, internally, foo|html is stored as a single
variable while "foo FILTER html" is stored as the variable foo which is then
passed to the the FILTER html.

A TT2 sample that would break in CGI::Ex::Template or TT3 is:

    [% PROCESS foo a = b | html %]

Under TT2 the content returned by "PROCESS foo a = b" would all be
passed to the html filter.  Under CGI::Ex::Template and TT3, b would
be passed to the html filter before assigning it to the variable "a"
before the template foo was processed.

A simple fix is to do any of the following:

    [% PROCESS foo a = b FILTER html %]

    [% | html %][% PROCESS foo a = b %][% END %]

    [% FILTER html %][% PROCESS foo a = b %][% END %]

This shouldn't be too much hardship and offers the great return of disambiguating
virtual method access.

=item C<**  ^  pow>

Binary.  X raised to the Y power.  This isn't available in TT 2.14.

    [% 2 ** 3 %] => 8

=item C<!>

Unary not.  Negation of the value.

=item C<-  unary_minus>

Unary minus.  Returns the value multiplied by -1.  The operator
"unary_minus" is used internally by CGI::Ex::Template to provide for -
to be listed in the precedence table twice.

    [% a = 1 ; b = -a ; b %] => -1

=item C<*>

Binary. Multiplication.

=item C</  div  DIV>

Binary. Division.  Note that / is floating point division, but div and
DIV are integer division.

   [% 10  /  4 %] => 2.5
   [% 10 div 4 %] => 2

=item C<%  mod  MOD>

Binary. Modulus.

   [% 15 % 8 %] => 7

=item C<+>

Binary.  Addition.

=item C<->

Binary.  Minus.

=item C<_  ~>

Binary.  String concatenation.

    [% "a" ~ "b" %] => ab

=item C<< <  >  <=  >= >>

Binary.  Numerical comparators.

=item C<lt  gt  le  ge>

Binary.  String comparators.

=item C<==  eq>

Binary.  Equality test.  TT chose to use Perl's eq for both operators.
There is no test for numeric equality.

=item C<!= ne>

Binary.  Non-equality test.  TT chose to use Perl's ne for both
operators.  There is no test for numeric non-equality.

=item C<&&>

Multiple arity.  And.  All values must be true.  If all values are true, the last
value is returned as the truth value.

    [% 2 && 3 && 4 %] => 4

=item C<||>

Multiple arity.  Or.  The first true value is returned.

    [% 0 || '' || 7 %] => 7

=item C<..>

Binary.  Range creator.  Returns an arrayref containing the values
between and including the first and last arguments.

    [% t = [1 .. 5] %] => variable t contains an array with 1,2,3,4, and 5

It is possible to place multiple ranges in the same [] constructor.  This is not available in TT.

    [% t = [1..3, 6..8] %] => variable t contains an array with 1,2,3,6,7,8

The .. operator is the only operator that returns a list of items.

=item C<? :>

Trinary.  Can be nested with other ?: pairs.

    [% 1 ? 2 : 3 %] => 2
    [% 0 ? 2 : 3 %] => 3

=item C<=>

Assignment.  Sets the lefthand side to the value of the righthand side.  In order
to not conflict with SET, FOREACH and other operations, this operator is only
available in parenthesis.  Returns the value of the righthand side.

   [% (a = 1) %] --- [% a %] => 1 --- 1

=item C<not  NOT>

Lower precedence version of the '!' operator.

=item C<and  AND>

Lower precedence version of the '&&' operator.

=item C<or OR>

Lower precedence version of the '||' operator.

=item C<hashref>

Multiple arity.  This operator is not used in TT.  It is used internally
by CGI::Ex::Template to delay the creation of a hashref until the
execution of the compiled template.

=item C<arrayref>

Multiple arity.  This operator is not used in TT.  It is used internally
by CGI::Ex::Template to delay the creation of an arrayref until the
execution of the compiled template.

=back



=head1 CONFIGURATION

The following TT2 configuration variables are supported (in
alphabetical order).  Note: for further discussion you can refer to
the TT config documentation.

These variables should be passed to the "new" constructor.

   my $obj = CGI::Ex::Template->new(
       VARIABLES  => \%hash_of_variables,
       AUTO_RESET => 0,
       TRIM       => 1,
       POST_CHOMP => 2,
       PRE_CHOMP  => 1,
   );


=over 4

=item ABSOLUTE

Boolean.  Default false.  Are absolute paths allowed for included files.

=item AUTO_RESET

Boolean.  Default 1.  Clear blocks that were set during the process method.

=item BLOCKS

A hashref of blocks that can be used by the process method.

   BLOCKS => {
       block_1 => sub { ... }, # coderef that returns a block
       block_2 => 'A String',  # simple string
   },

Note that a Template::Document cannot be supplied as a value (TT
supports this).  However, it is possible to supply a value that is
equal to the hashref returned by the load_parsed_tree method.

=item CACHE_SIZE

Number of compiled templates to keep in memory.  Default undef.
Undefined means to allow all templates to cache.  A value of 0 will
force no caching.  The cache mechanism will clear templates that have
not been used recently.

=item COMPILE_DIR

Base directory to store compiled templates.  Default undef. Compiled
templates will only be stored if one of COMPILE_DIR and COMPILE_EXT is
set.

=item COMPILE_EXT

Extension to add to stored compiled template filenames.  Default undef.

=item CONSTANTS

Hashref.  Used to define variables that will be "folded" into the
compiled template.  Variables defined here cannot be overridden.

    CONSTANTS => {my_constant => 42},

    A template containing:

    [% constants.my_constant %]

    Will have the value 42 compiled in.

Constants defined in this way can be chained as in [%
constant.foo.bar.baz %] but may only interpolate values that are set
before the compile process begins.  This goes one step beyond TT in
that any variable set in VARIABLES, or PRE_DEFINE, or passed to the
process method are allowed - they are not in TT.  Variables defined in
the template are not available during the compile process.

    GOOD:

    CONSTANTS => {
        foo  => {
            bar => {baz => 42},
            bim => 57,
        },
        bing => 'baz',
        bang => 'bim',
    },
    VARIABLES => {
        bam  => 'bar',
    },

    In the template

    [% constants.foo.${constants.bang} %]

    Will correctly print 57.

    GOOD (non-tt behavior)

    [% constants.foo.$bam.${constants.bing} %]

    CGI::Ex::Template will print 42 because the value of bam is
    known at compile time.  TT would print '' because the value of $bam
    is not yet defined in the TT engine.

    BAD:

    In the template:

    [% bam = 'somethingelse' %]
    [% constants.foo.$bam.${constants.bing} %]

    Will still print 42 because the value of bam used comes from
    variables defined before the template was compiled.  TT will still print ''.

=item CONSTANT_NAMESPACE


=item DEBUG

    Takes a list of constants |'ed together which enables different
    debugging modes.  Alternately the lowercase names may be used (multiple
    values joined by a ",".

    The only supported TT values are:
    DEBUG_UNDEF (2)    - debug when an undefined value is used.
    DEBUG_DIRS  (8)    - debug when a directive is used.
    DEBUG_ALL   (2047) - turn on all debugging.

    Either of the following would turn on undef and directive debugging:

    DEBUG => 'undef, dirs',            # preferred
    DEBUG => 2 | 8,
    DEBUG => DEBUG_UNDEF | DEBUG_DIRS, # constants from Template::Constants

=item DEBUG_FORMAT



=item DEFAULT



=item DELIMITER

String to use to split INCLUDE_PATH with.  Default is :.  It is more
straight forward to just send INCLUDE_PATH an arrayref of paths.

=item END_TAG



=item EVAL_PERL

Boolean.  Default false.  If set to a true value, PERL and RAWPERL blocks
will be allowed to run.  This is a potential security hole, as arbitrary
perl can be included in the template.  If Template::Toolkit is installed,
a true EVAL_PERL value also allows the perl and evalperl filters to be used.

=item FILTERS



=item INCLUDE_PATH

A string or an arrayref or coderef that returns an arrayref that
contains directories to look for files included by processed
templates.

=item INCLUDE_PATHS

Non-TT item.  Same as INCLUDE_PATH but only takes an arrayref.  If not specified
then INCLUDE_PATH is turned into an arrayref and stored in INCLUDE_PATHS.
Overrides INCLUDE_PATH.

=item INTERPOLATE

Boolean.  Specifies whether variables in text portions of the template will be
interpolated.  For example, the $variable and ${var.value} would be substituted
with the appropriate values from the variable cache (if INTERPOLATE is on).

    [% IF 1 %]The variable $variable had a value ${var.value}[% END %]


=item LOAD_PERL



=item NAMESPACE - no Template::Namespace::Constants support



=item OUTPUT



=item OUTPUT_PATH



=item PLUGINS



=item PLUGIN_BASE



=item POST_CHOMP



=item POST_PROCESS



=item PRE_CHOMP



=item PRE_DEFINE



=item PRE_PROCESS



=item PROCESS



=item RECURSION



=item RELATIVE

Boolean.  Default false.  If true, allows filenames to be specified
that are relative to the currently running process.

=item START_TAG



=item TAG_STYLE


=item TRIM

Remove leading and trailing whitespace from blocks and templates.
This operation is performed after all enclosed template tags have
been executed.

=item UNDEFINED_ANY

This is not a TT configuration option.  This option expects to be a code
ref that will be called if a variable is undefined during a call to get_variable.
It is passed the variable identity array as a single argument.  This
is most similar to the "undefined" method of Template::Stash.  It allows
for the "auto-defining" of a variable for use in the template.  It is
suggested that UNDEFINED_GET be used instead as UNDEFINED_ANY is a little
to general in defining variables.

You can also sub class the module and override the undefined_any method.

=item UNDEFINED_GET

This is not a TT configuration option.  This option expects to be a code
ref that will be called if a variable is undefined during a call to GET.
It is passed the variable identity array as a single argument.  This is more useful
than UNDEFINED_ANY in that it is only called during a GET directive
rather than in embedded expressions (such as [% a || b || c %]).

You can also sub class the module and override the undefined_get method.

=item VARIABLES

A hashref of variables to initialize the template stash with.  These
variables are available for use in any of the executed templates.

=back



=head1 UNSUPPORTED TT CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item ANYCASE

This will not be supported.  You will have to use the full case directive names.
(It was in the beta code but was removed prior to release).

=item WRAPPER

This will be supported - just not done yet.

=item ERROR

This will be supported - just not done yet.

=item V1DOLLAR

This will not be supported.

=item LOAD_TEMPLATES

CGI::Ex::Template has its own mechanism for loading and storing
compiled templates.  TT would use a Template::Provider that would
return a Template::Document.  The closest thing in CGI::Ex::Template
is the load_parsed_template method.  There is no immediate plan to
support the TT behavior.

=item LOAD_PLUGINS

CGI::Ex::Template uses its own mechanism for loading plugins.  TT
would use a Template::Plugins object to load plugins requested via the
USE directive.  The functionality for doing this in CGI::Ex::Template
is contained in the list_plugins method and the play_USE method.  There
is no immediate plan to support the TT behavior.

Full support is offered for the PLUGINS and LOAD_PERL configuration items.

Also note that CGI::Ex::Template only natively supports the Iterator plugin.
Any of the other plugins requested will need to provided by installing
Template::Toolkit or the appropriate plugin module.

=item LOAD_FILTERS

CGI::Ex::Template uses its own mechanism for loading filters.  TT
would use the Template::Filters object to load filters requested via the
FILTER directive.  The functionality for doing this in CGI::Ex::Template
is contained in the list_filters method and the get_variable method.

Full support is offered for the FILTERS configuration item.

=item TOLERANT

This option is used by the LOAD_TEMPLATES and LOAD_PLUGINS options and
is not applicable in CGI::Ex::Template.

=item SERVICE

CGI::Ex::Template has no concept of service (theoretically the CGI::Ex::Template
is the "service").

=item CONTEXT

CGI::Ex::Template provides its own pseudo context object to plugins,
filters, and perl blocks.  The CGI::Ex::Template model doesn't really
allow for a separate context.  CGI::Ex::Template IS the context.

=item STASH

CGI::Ex::Template manages its own stash of variables.  A pseudo stash
object is available via the pseudo context object for use in plugins,
filters, and perl blocks.

=item PARSER

CGI::Ex::Template has its own built in parser.  The closest similarity is
the parse_tree method.  The output of parse_tree is an optree that is
later run by execute_tree.

=item GRAMMAR

CGI::Ex::Template maintains its own grammar.  The grammar is defined
in the parse_tree method and the callbacks listed in the global
$DIRECTIVES hashref.

=back


=head1 VARIABLE PARSE TREE

CGI::Ex::Template parses templates into an tree of operations.  Even
variable access is parsed into a tree.  This is done in a manner
somewhat similar to the way that TT operates except that nested
variables such as foo.bar|baz contain the '.' or '|' in between each
name level.  Opererators are parsed and stored as part of the variable (it
may be more appropriate to say we are parsing a term or an expression).

The following table shows a variable or expression and the corresponding parsed tree
(this is what the parse_variable method would return).

    one                [ 'one',  0 ]
    one()              [ 'one',  [] ]
    one.two            [ 'one',  0, '.', 'two',  0 ]
    one|two            [ 'one',  0, '|', 'two',  0 ]
    one.$two           [ 'one',  0, '.', ['two', 0 ], 0 ]
    one(two)           [ 'one',  [ ['two', 0] ] ]
    one.${two().three} [ 'one',  0, '.', ['two', [], '.', 'three', 0], 0]
    2.34               2.34
    "one"              "one"
    "one"|length       [ \"one", 0, '|', 'length', 0 ]
    "one $a two"       [ \ [ '~', 'one ', ['a', 0], ' two' ], 0 ]
    [0, 1, 2]          [ \ [ 'array', 0, 1, 2 ], 0 ]
    [0, 1, 2].size     [ \ [ 'array', 0, 1, 2 ], 0, '.', 'size', 0 ]
    ['a', a, $a ]      [ \ [ 'array', 'a', ['a', 0], [['a', 0], 0] ], 0]
    {a  => 'b'}        [ \ [ 'hash',  'a', 'b' ], 0 ]
    {a  => 'b'}.size   [ \ [ 'hash',  'a', 'b' ], 0, '.', 'size', 0 ]
    {$a => b}          [ \ [ 'hash',  ['a', 0], ['b', 0] ], 0 ]
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4      [ \ [ '+', 1, 2, 3, 4 ], 0]
    a + b              [ \ [ '+', ['a', 0], ['b', 0] ], 0 ]
    a * (b + c)        [ \ [ '*', ['a', 0], [ \ ['+', ['b', 0], ['c', 0]], 0 ]], 0 ]
    (a + b)            [ \ [ '+', ['a', 0], ['b', 0] ]], 0 ]
    (a + b) * c        [ \ [ '*', [ \ [ '+', ['a', 0], ['b', 0] ], 0 ], ['c', 0] ], 0 ]
    a ? b : c          [ \ [ '?', ['a', 0], ['b', 0], ['c', 0] ], 0 ]
    a || b || c        [ \ [ '||', ['a', 0], ['b', 0], ['c', 0] ], 0 ]
    ! a                [ \ [ '!', ['a', 0] ], 0 ]

Some notes on the parsing.

    Operators are parsed as part of the variable and become part of the variable tree.

    Operators are stored in the variable tree using a reference to the arrayref - which
    allows for quickly decending the parsed variable tree and determining that the next
    node is an operator.

    Parens () can be used at any point in an expression to disambiguate precedence.

    "Variables" that appear to be literal strings or literal numbers
    are returned as the literal (no operator tree).

The following perl can be typed at the command line to view the parsed variable tree.

    perl -e 'use CGI::Ex::Template; print CGI::Ex::Template::dump_parse("foo.bar + 2")."\n"'
